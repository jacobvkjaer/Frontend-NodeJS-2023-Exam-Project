      description:
        'George Orwell is the pen name of the author, Eric Arthur Blair. He was an English essayist, novelist, journalist and critic. His writings are based on social criticism, anti-Fascism, anarchism and support to democratic Socialism. His work remains influential in popular culture and political culture. 1984, a novel, is based on dystopian social science. Its theme is projected on the consequences of mass surveillance, totalitarianism and societal behavior aspect. The author had been a democratic socialist. Mostly, the novel narrates the truth and facts within politics and how come these are manipulated. The author has narrated in on imaginary manner when most of the parts of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, global mass surveillance, historical nogationism. A huge, propaganda is there. The story reveals that Great Britain, known as Arstri One, has become a province of totalitarian superstate named Okeania. The leader of the party is Big Brother. Actually, its a cult of personality and arises anyone uses the techniques of mass media, social networking, government organised demonstrations and ralies to create an image of a leader. It is often seen in totalitarian or authorisation states. Winston Smith is a protagonist, who is very skillful and outer party member and hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. His relationship with Julia has also come up. 1984 has become a classic literacy example of political and dystopian fiction. Time magazine included this novel on its 100-best English-language novels. Although, Orwell was hesitating for this title but Warbury (the Publisher) suggested this which he took to be a more commercially viable choice. The story behind its title is also very interesting, when Orwell finished this novel in 1948, this title was chosen simply as the inversion of this year. So, at last, in the story, there is a celebration of massive victory of Okeanias over Eurasian armies in Africa. Also, Winston accepted that he loves Big Brother. How this happened? What were the circumstances Winston refused to love Julia? How this political storm took place? For all, the story reveals step by step in an interesting manner. A mind-blowing novel of that time and forever.',
